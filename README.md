# hot_100_scraper
Based on https://github.com/jsubroto/billboard-hot-100-web-scraper/blob/master/billboard_hot_100_websraper.py, reworked to be more robust + works with updated site format

No command line options, I wrote this mostly for personal use and I'm too lazy to add them.

Pull script will create a new file. Append script will add columns to an existing file.

Update dates to change the pull window.  Update the URL (you can remove '+ date if desired') to pull different charts. Should work on any billboard chart, not affected by paywalls.
